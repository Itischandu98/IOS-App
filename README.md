# IOS-App
This is an app built for controlling of the LED-matrix program that is hosted on the raspberry pi

## Note for self
This is the first IOS app that i have build for my Iphone SE to control the led matrix in my room, I did this so if have enough money to buy microcontrollers I would like to automate stuff in home and I would need a app to control all the devices. It only works on local network would look for a work around.

You can look at this program as a simple example to send get requests to a flask app from the IOS swift app.
